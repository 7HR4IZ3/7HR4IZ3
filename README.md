## About Me

I'm an 18-year-old Nigerian coder who loves diving deep into programming and technology. My journey is all about breaking and fixing things, innovating with code, and building projects that make a difference. Currently, I'm expanding my horizons by exploring Rust and integrating it with my existing projects.

- ðŸ”­ **Current Project:**  
  Working on [Acode NodeJS](https://github.com/7HR4IZ3/Acode) â€“ a fork of [Acode](https://github.com/deadlyjack/Acode). Itâ€™s essentially bringing the power of VSCode to mobile with a built-in NodeJS runtime and extended plugin API.
  
- ðŸŒ± **Learning:**  
  Mastering Rust to broaden my toolset and improve my project robustness.
  
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask Me About:**  
  Python, Backend Development, REST API Integrations, and more.
